I am a junior at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu) studying physics, computer science, and math. 

My academic and scientific interests evolve frequently, but broadly I'm into applied physics: using physics principles to investigate phenomena and create technologies that can be applied in real-world contexts. Most recently, I spent a summer in the Materials Science Division of [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://pls.llnl.gov/research-and-development/materials-science), where I utilized a variety of image and signal processing techniques to understand the turbulent physical processes that govern [laser drilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_drilling). That work will be published in an upcoming paper. In the past I've also worked on condensed matter physics/2D materials research in Columbia's [Pasupathy Lab](https://anp-lab.physics.columbia.edu/) and volumetric light-sheet imaging at the [Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging](https://hillmanlab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute.

I graduated from Interlake High School in Bellevue, WA in 2021. During my senior year, I interned with [Prof. Tom Quinn](https://nbody.shop/) at the University of Washington's Department of Astronomy, where I worked on particle simulation codes. I was also heavily involved in policy debate, for which I was squad captain my senior year.

Some of my other interests include [badminton](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/badminton/), [science outreach](https://www.thecolumbiasciencereview.com/), my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/r.omeow/?hl=en), philosophy, writing (both of the creative and nonfiction sort), cookies (both consuming and creating), and slowly improving my Chinese fluency.

## Fun facts
* My [:Fischer number](#fischer) is 2.
* I once ran a marathon on a month of training ... it was painful but absolutely worth it.

## :x fischer
The "Fischer Number" is an idea invented by Christian Hesse based on the famous "six degrees of separation" concept. Bobby Fischer was the 11th World Chess Champion and considered by many as the greatest chess player of all time. One's "Fischer number" is calculated as such: Bobby Fischer himself has Fischer number 0. If you have beaten Bobby Fischer in a tournament, your Fischer number is 1. If you have beaten someone with a Fischer number 1, your Fischer number is 2, etc. Some famous chess players' Fischer numbers are as follows: Garry Kasparov, 2; Magnus Carlsen, 3; Deep Blue, 3; etc.

My Fischer number is 2, due to an extremely fortune series of circumstances. When I was young, I used to play at the Seattle Chess Club. One of the stalwarts of this little club was a man named [Viktor Pupols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktors_Pupols). At this point he clearly played only for fun, but still retained a rating above master strength. In 2016, I managed to beat him in a tournament game.

It turns out that [Pupols himself in fact beat Bobby Fischer](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044024), in the US Junior Championship 1955 (some sixty years prior). This was supposedly one of only two games Fischer ever lost on time.
