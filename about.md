I am a junior at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu) studying physics, computer science, and math. 

My academic and scientific interests evolve frequently, but broadly I'm into applied physics: using physics principles to investigate phenomena and create technologies that can be applied in real-world contexts. Most recently, I spent a summer in the Materials Science Division of [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://pls.llnl.gov/research-and-development/materials-science), where I utilized a variety of image and signal processing techniques to understand the turbulent physical processes that govern [laser drilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_drilling). That work will be published in an upcoming paper. In the past I've also worked on condensed matter physics/2D materials research in Columbia's [Pasupathy Lab](https://anp-lab.physics.columbia.edu/) and volumetric light-sheet imaging at the [Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging](https://hillmanlab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute.

I graduated from Interlake High School in Bellevue, WA in 2021. During my senior year, I interned with [Prof. Tom Quinn](https://nbody.shop/) at the University of Washington's Department of Astronomy, where I worked on particle simulation codes. I was also heavily involved in policy debate, for which I was squad captain my senior year.

Some of my other interests include [badminton](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/badminton/), [science outreach](https://www.thecolumbiasciencereview.com/), my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/r.omeow/?hl=en), philosophy, writing (both of the creative and nonfiction sort), cookies (both consuming and creating), and slowly improving my Chinese fluency.
