I am a sophomore at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu) studying physics. I currently work in Columbia's [Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging](https://hillmanlab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), where I help improve the resolution, efficiency, and usability of light-sheet microscopy systems for biological imaging. In high school, I interned with [Prof. Tom Quinn](https://nbody.shop/) at the University of Washington's Department of Astronomy, where I worked on particle simulation codes.

Some of my other interests include [badminton](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/badminton/), science outreach, my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/r.omeow/?hl=en), philosophy, computer science, scrolling through Wikipedia for hours, and slowly improving my Chinese fluency.
