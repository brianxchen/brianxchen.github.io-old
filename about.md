I am currently sophomore at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu) studying physics and math.

I attended Interlake High School in Bellevue, WA. During my senior year, I interned with [Prof. Tom Quinn](https://nbody.shop/) at the University of Washington's Department of Astronomy, where I worked on particle simulation codes. I was also heavily involved in policy debate, for which I was squad captain my senior year.

Some of my other interests include [badminton](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/badminton/), [science outreach](https://www.thecolumbiasciencereview.com/), my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/r.omeow/?hl=en), philosophy, writing (both of the creative and nonfiction sort), computer science, cookies (both consuming and creating), and slowly improving my Chinese fluency.
