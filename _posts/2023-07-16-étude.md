you can’t touch the sky, but sometimes you’re \ 
walking through a golden field, or waking \ 
to the sun’s tender gaze, that old stranger and \ 
new friend, and you remember what it was like \ 
twelve years ago, when your only fickle \ 
thoughts were that new box of cheerios at \ 
home and your mom’s \ 
beckoning eyes. \

peace is a reticent friend, and its fingers slip \ 
past yours, a ghostly wind, and soon you can’t \ 
remember its name but its warmth plays with \ 
your hair, that étude of softspoken love, and \ 
the breeze laughs and sweeps the \ 
words right off of \ 
your lips. \

on earth i’ve smelled tulips brighter than \ 
embers and felt shimmering nights caress \ 
my arm, but nothing quite compares to \
that gentle request: \
let’s stay \
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎ a second \
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎  ‎   ‎ ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎ longer?
